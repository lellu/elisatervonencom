    "info1": "Currently I'm working as a web developer at Liana Technologies. I have been working with web development for over ten years. My work demands technical and organizational skills. At the same time it requires creative problem solving skills and capability to work in group-setting as the work involves a lot of communication between different people. All this makes my work pleasant and interesting on a daily basis.",
